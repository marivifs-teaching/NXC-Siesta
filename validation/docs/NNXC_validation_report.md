**Project:** Neural-Network GGA XC Functional (SIESTA ↔ JAX Consistency)

**Location:** `Util/NXC/debug/`

**Objective:**
Establish numerical equivalence between the JAX/Equinox implementation of the NN-based GGA exchange–correlation functional and the Fortran implementation used in SIESTA (SiestaXC), targeting ~1e-8 agreement for first-order analytic derivatives.

---

# 1. Problem Statement

The NN-based GGA functional was implemented in two environments:

- **Python/JAX (Equinox)** — used for training and PySCF validation.
- **Fortran (SiestaXC)** — used inside SIESTA.

Initial comparisons showed:

- Enhancement factors differed at ~1e-3 level.
- Gradient derivatives showed significant discrepancies.

Goal: Identify and eliminate all discrepancies attributable to implementation differences.

# 2. Validation Strategy

Validation was performed in increasing levels of complexity:

1. Validate NN forward pass (Fx, Fc) with LDA reference disabled.
2. Validate analytic first derivatives w.r.t. density and gradient.
3. Validate full 1D analytic density test.
4. Validate real 3D grid test using saved SIESTA densities.
5. Avoid direct comparison of final XC potential due to discretization differences.

# 3. Root Cause #1 — GELU Mismatch

### Observation
Raw MLP outputs differed at ~1e-3 level.

### Diagnosis
JAX version:
```
jax 0.7.0
jax.nn.gelu(x, approximate=True)
```

Default activation = **tanh-approximate GELU**.

Fortran implementation used:

\[
\text{GELU}_{erf}(x) = \tfrac12 x (1 + \mathrm{erf}(x/\sqrt2))
\]

### Fix
Replaced Fortran GELU with tanh approximation:

\[
 u = \sqrt{2/\pi}(x + 0.044715x^3)
\]
\[
 \mathrm{gelu}(x) = \tfrac12 x (1 + \tanh u)
\]

Derivative implemented analytically.

### Result
Raw MLP output agreement:

- `Fx raw y` match ~1e-15
- `Fc raw y` match ~1e-15

Enhancement factors now agree at machine precision.

# 4. Root Cause #2 — Exchange Gradient Prefactor

### Observation
Full 1D test showed:

```
vgradx max|diff| ≈ 3e-2
```

### Diagnosis
Exchange gradient mapping in `NNGGAXC` used:

```
dEXdGD = 2 * dedg_x * Grad / |Grad|
```

But `dedg_x` already represented:

\[
\frac{\partial e_x}{\partial g}
\]

Correct mapping:

\[
\frac{\partial e_x}{\partial \nabla \rho} =
\frac{\partial e_x}{\partial g} \frac{\nabla \rho}{g}
\]

No extra factor 2.

### Fix
Removed `2.0_dp` prefactors in exchange `dEXdGD`.

### Result
1D test results:

```
vgradx max|diff| ≈ 4.4e-8
```

Matches gradient tolerance target.

# 5. 1D Analytic Density Validation

Density:
\[
\rho(x) = \rho_0(1 - (x/L)^2)
\]

Results:

| Quantity | Max | RMS |
|-----------|------|------|
| exc | ~2.5e-7 | ~2.1e-7 |
| edens | ~2.0e-7 | ~1.4e-7 |
| vrho | ~3.1e-7 | ~2.8e-7 |
| vgradx | ~4.4e-8 | ~1.7e-8 |

Remaining ~1e-7 differences attributed to LDA reference implementation differences.

# 6. 3D Real Grid Validation

Procedure:

- Generated `fortran_grid.csv` using SIESTA `NNGGAXC`.
- Generated `jax_grid.csv` using PySCF/JAX.
- Compared:
  - `exc`
  - `edens`
  - `vrhou`, `vrhod`
  - Gradient-vector derivatives

Direct comparison of vsigma components avoided due to inversion instability.

Recommended robust comparison:

Compare gradient-vector derivatives:

\[
\mathbf P_\uparrow = 2 v_{uu} \mathbf G_\uparrow + v_{ud} \mathbf G_\downarrow
\]
\[
\mathbf P_\downarrow = 2 v_{dd} \mathbf G_\downarrow + v_{ud} \mathbf G_\uparrow
\]

This avoids ill-conditioning when gradients are parallel.

---

# 7. Important Conceptual Note

SIESTA computes:

\[
v_{xc} = \frac{\partial e}{\partial \rho} - \nabla \cdot
\left( \frac{\partial e}{\partial \nabla \rho} \right)
\]

with the divergence evaluated numerically on the grid.

PySCF may evaluate analytic higher derivatives.

Therefore:

> Direct comparison of final XC potentials is not a pure NN validation test.

Discrepancies may arise purely from discretization.

---

# 8. Final Status

✔ NN forward pass identical (machine precision).
✔ First-order analytic derivatives consistent (~1e-8).
✔ Exchange gradient mapping corrected.
✔ Remaining energy-level differences attributed to LDA reference conventions.

The NN implementation in SIESTA is now validated against the JAX reference.

---

# 9. Reproducibility Notes

- JAX version: 0.7.0
- GELU must use `approximate=True` (tanh form).
- Always validate using Fx/Fc first before testing full XC potential.
